		<p>
		Each of the modules below lets students experiment with a variety of mathematical models for planetary structure, 
		heat flow and rotation among other modeled properties.
		</p>
		<p>
		Interaction with the modules is entirely open-ended.
		Students may explore what happens when the values of specific variables are changed in the various embedded mathematical models.
		A common feature is to interactively 'fit' real-world data with a linear equation, 
		where sliders control the slope and intercept values.
		</p>
		<p>
		The modules are adapted from <a href="//spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/ILabs.html">Space Math @ NASA ILabs</a>.

		The location of the InSight lander will be determined when it touches down in terms of its martian latitude and longitude.
		A marsquake or the impact of a meteor will occur at some other spot on Mars, also given by its latitude and longitude.
		This program calculates how far apart these two spots are from each other by setting their latitudes and longitudes.

		The InSight seismometer will detect the arrival of marsquake or meteor impact seismic waves.
		These waves, like the ripples of water from a stone dropped in a pond, travel on the surface of Mars.
		There are two waves that travel around Mars called Rayleigh 1 and Rayleigh 2.
		The R1 wave arrives first, and the R2 wave travels a longer distance and arrives next.
		These waves can also continue to travel around Mars back to the seismometer and are then called R3 and R4.
		</p>
		<p>
		This program calculates how long these Rayleigh waves take to reach the InSight seismometer.<br>

		In the winter, you heat the inside of your home to a comfortable temperature.
		To make sure that this heat stays inside your home you add insulation to your walls and attic.
		The inside of Mars is very warm, just like the core of our planet Earth.
		This heat travels through the planet and escapes through its surface.
		The rock and surface material of Mars acts like the insulation in the attic of a house.
		Heat energy escaping the planet's surface, called the heat flux.
		The change in temperature with depth can be used to figure out what kind of material is in the surface of Mars.
		This lab lets you adjust the heat flow and type of surface material to predict how the surface temperature changes with depth.
